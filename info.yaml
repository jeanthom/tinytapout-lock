# TinyTapeout project information
#
# As everyone will have access to all designs, try to make it easy for someone new to your design to know what
# it does and how to operate it.
#
# This will be automatically collected and used to make a datasheet for the chip.

  title:        "Digital padlock"
  description:  "A 4-digit electronic padlock"
  how_it_works: "Each buttons press is detected by a rising edge detector, and each button press is decoded into a binary code. That binary code is stored in a shift-register which is continuously checked against a reference value ('the padlock code')."
  how_to_test:  "Connect a clock generator to the clock input, connect all four buttons with a debounce circuit - the buttons should act as active high."
